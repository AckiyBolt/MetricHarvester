MetricHarvester
===============
This is "Multi-agent system". It will be my diploma. Eah... "Multi-agent system"... *trollface*

Destination of this monster - scheduled harvesting hardware metrics (CPU, RAM, etc.) on VPS.
In reality it's a little system that consists of few modules.

Master  - server agent that generates its own will;
Slave   - VPS agent that executes master's will;
Core    - slavery laws =)

This project uses ActiveMQ and Sigar now. Some other thigs (like DB) will be in future.

More deeper description of this funniest "Multi-agent system" i'm going to provide later.
